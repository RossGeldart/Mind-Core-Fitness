I tell people to pick two days of the week that are non-negotiable. Don't worry about how long the sessions are. Don't put a time on it. Just get there. The rest builds from that."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes, of course you can. There's plenty you can do at home with no equipment or a very basic setup. It all comes down to nutrition and self-discipline. With the right food choices and intense workouts at home, you can get in great shape. Core Buddy is built for exactly this — it generates workouts you can do anywhere, on your own terms, with whatever equipment you have."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Everyone in that gym has been exactly where you are. They all started somewhere, so don't think for a minute they're judging you. Yes, you'll get the odd prick who might have something to say — but that's his problem, not yours. You'll actually find that most people in the gym are helpful if you just ask. And if you're really not ready to go it alone, that's what 1-to-1 personal training is for — we build your confidence up together until you don't need me anymore."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Because motivation is just the spark that gets you through the door. After that first session, it's not about motivation anymore — it's about building momentum. If you're struggling, ask yourself the honest question: why am I not feeling it? It's usually an emotional thing. Dig deep and try to understand your own actions. The answer's normally in there somewhere."

You just allow yourself more rest time between exercises. As you progress, you reduce the rest intervals to build your stamina and strength over time."

It's easy to fall off track and eat more than you realise, so keeping track — even just until you're confident about what you're eating — is well worth the effort. Core Buddy has a built-in macro calculator and food tracker that makes this simple."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The general guideline is around 1.5 to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of your bodyweight. But if that feels overwhelming right now, just start by prioritising protein in your meals. Make it the first thing on your plate. The numbers can come later once you've built the habit."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Keep it simple. Have something carb-rich about an hour before you train — that's your fuel. After your session, focus on getting protein in to help your body recover. And be mindful of your carb intake later in the evening. If you're not using that energy, your body doesn't need it sitting around."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "The two run side by side in my opinion. I don't like the word \"diet\" — it implies something temporary. Instead, just be mindful of what you're eating and make sure you're moving every day and giving everything you've got in your sessions. You don't need to overhaul your entire life in one go. Small changes in both, at the same time, is what works."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Discipline yourself Monday to Friday. Treat each weekday like a school day. Then at the weekend, have your treat. Here's what I tell my clients: list the four things you know you should be cutting out but you enjoy. Then treat yourself to one of those things at the weekend, and rotate through them over the course of a month. You'll find you appreciate them more when they're earned."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Core Buddy takes away the overwhelm from fitness. You can generate a workout in seconds based on the time you have and the equipment available to you. The workouts are interval-based. On top of that, you can calculate your macros, track your food, track your daily habits, take part in challenges, earn badges, and connect with others through the social features. It's everything in one place, kept simple."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "Yes. Free users get access with two workouts per week and one daily habit to track. If you want full access to all the features — unlimited workouts, full food tracking, macro calculator, challenges, badges, and social features — that's the premium plan."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "It takes away the seriousness. A lot of fitness apps feel like a commitment — rigid programmes, guilt if you miss a day, complicated tracking. Core Buddy isn't like that. You come in, work out at your own pace, and track things with ease. It meets you where you are, not where some app thinks you should be. Same philosophy as my coaching — no pressure, just progress."

          "acceptedAnswer": {
            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "In person is what personal training is all about. Things can get missed online and the accountability isn't the same. When we're in the gym together, there's no bullshit — just genuine collaboration in real time. That said, online coaching still works well for people who can't get to Elgin. It's just a different experience."

                <h2>Getting Started with Fitness</h2>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>How often should I work out as a complete beginner?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Start small. The first thing you need to do is get yourself in the environment &mdash; that's where your mindset starts to shift. I tell people to pick two days of the week that are non-negotiable. Don't worry about how long the sessions are. Don't put a time on it. Just get there. The rest builds from that.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Become a beginner again. Every day's a school day. It doesn't matter how long it's been &mdash; the starting point is the same for everyone. Get yourself in the environment. Show up. That's step one whether you're completely new or picking things back up after years away.</p>
                    </div>

                    <summary>Can I get fit without going to a gym?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, of course you can. There's plenty you can do at home with no equipment or a very basic setup. It all comes down to nutrition and self-discipline. With the right food choices and intense workouts at home, you can get in great shape. Core Buddy is built for exactly this &mdash; it generates workouts you can do anywhere, on your own terms, with whatever equipment you have.</p>

                        <p>Everyone in that gym has been exactly where you are. They all started somewhere, so don't think for a minute they're judging you. Yes, you'll get the odd prick who might have something to say &mdash; but that's his problem, not yours. You'll actually find that most people in the gym are helpful if you just ask. And if you're really not ready to go it alone, that's what 1-to-1 personal training is for &mdash; we build your confidence up together until you don't need me anymore.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Life gets busy. If you miss a day, don't beat yourself up about it. But if you do fall off course, start small again. Pick one day and make it non-negotiable. From that single day, you build momentum. Momentum is what keeps you going &mdash; not motivation.</p>
                    </div>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Why do I lose motivation after the first week?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Because motivation is just the spark that gets you through the door. After that first session, it's not about motivation anymore &mdash; it's about building momentum. If you're struggling, ask yourself the honest question: why am I not feeling it? It's usually an emotional thing. Dig deep and try to understand your own actions.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>HIIT stands for High Intensity Interval Training &mdash; it's a workout routine based on timed intervals of work and rest. And yes, you can absolutely do it as a beginner. You just allow yourself more rest time between exercises. As you progress, you reduce the rest intervals to build your stamina and strength over time.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Of course it is. One minute is worth it. Any time you invest in moving your body has value. If someone tells you 10 minutes isn't enough, that person doesn't understand the value of the effort you're putting in. Every minute counts.</p>

                        <p>There's nothing wrong with doing HIIT every day. Just be mindful of how you're feeling. If you've got the energy and the drive to train today, then train. If you don't, rest. Listen to your body &mdash; it'll tell you what it needs.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>I'd recommend it, especially at the start. It's easy to fall off track and eat more than you realise, so keeping track &mdash; even just until you're confident about what you're eating &mdash; is well worth the effort. Core Buddy has a built-in macro calculator and food tracker that makes this simple.</p>

                    <summary>How much protein should I be eating?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The general guideline is around 1.5 to 2 grams of protein per kilogram of your bodyweight. But if that feels overwhelming right now, just start by prioritising protein in your meals. Make it the first thing on your plate. The numbers can come later once you've built the habit.</p>

                    <summary>What should I eat before and after a workout?</summary>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Keep it simple. Have something carb-rich about an hour before you train &mdash; that's your fuel. After your session, focus on getting protein in to help your body recover. And be mindful of your carb intake later in the evening. If you're not using that energy, your body doesn't need it sitting around.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The two run side by side in my opinion. I don't like the word "diet" &mdash; it implies something temporary. Instead, just be mindful of what you're eating and make sure you're moving every day and giving everything you've got in your sessions. You don't need to overhaul your entire life in one go. Small changes in both, at the same time, is what works.</p>

                        <p>Discipline yourself Monday to Friday. Treat each weekday like a school day. Then at the weekend, have your treat. Here's what I tell my clients: list the four things you know you should be cutting out but you enjoy. Then treat yourself to one of those things at the weekend, and rotate through them over the course of a month. You'll find you appreciate them more when they're earned.</p>

                        <p>Core Buddy takes away the overwhelm from fitness. You can generate a workout in seconds based on the time you have and the equipment available to you.

On top of that, you can calculate your macros, track your food, track your daily habits, take part in challenges, earn badges, and connect with others through the social features. It's everything in one place, kept simple.</p>

                        <p>It takes away the seriousness. A lot of fitness apps feel like a commitment &mdash; rigid programmes, guilt if you miss a day, complicated tracking. Core Buddy isn't like that. You come in, work out at your own pace, and track things with ease. It meets you where you are, not where some app thinks you should be.
