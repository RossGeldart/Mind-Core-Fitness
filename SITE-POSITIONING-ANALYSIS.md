## The Core Problem

The site tries to be 5 businesses at once. A visitor has to choose between in-person training, online coaching, a self-guided programme, a fitness app, AND a journal. That's decision paralysis for the exact person you say you serve — busy, overwhelmed people.

Your structured data says: _"Fitness coach specialising in accessible training for busy, overwhelmed people."_ But the site overwhelms them with choices.

## Recommendations

### KEEP & DOUBLE DOWN

**1-2-1 Personal Training** — Your bread and butter. 200+ clients, 5-star Google reviews, testimonials from people like Scott (53, lost 25kg). Highest-value, highest-trust offering. Middle-aged people want accountability and a real human. Make this the hero.

**Core Buddy** — Your scalable play. Fits the "busy" angle (5–30 min workouts, no gym required, habit tracking). Position as the entry point / stepping stone to working with you, not an equal alongside PT. "Not ready for 1-2-1 yet? Start here."

### RETHINK

**Online Coaching vs 12-Week Programme** — These overlap. A busy middle-aged person doesn't know the difference between "Online Coaching," "12-Week Core Programme," and "Core Buddy." They're all "online fitness things." Pick one digital path, not three. Fold Online Coaching into the 12-Week Programme page.

### DEMOTE

**Mindset Workbook** — At £9.99–£19.99, it's a low-margin distraction from £240–£1,200 services. It competes with Core Buddy for the "self-guided" customer. The journaling concept could be a Core Buddy feature instead. Remove from nav and homepage; keep the page live for Amazon/direct links. Offer as a bonus for PT clients or Core Buddy subscribers.

## Quick Wins for the Middle-Aged Audience

1. **Lead with Scott's story** — A 53-year-old who lost 25kg is your ideal testimonial for this demographic. Put it front and centre.

2. **Rethink the headline** — "Build Strength. Transform Your Life." is generic. Something like "Fitness That Fits Your Life" or "Get Stronger Without Giving Up Your Life" speaks directly to 40–55 year olds.

3. **Shift blog content** — 14 of 22 posts are specific HIIT workouts. For busy middle-aged people, content about overcoming barriers, starting after a long break, training around injuries/desk jobs, and managing fitness with family would resonate more.

4. **Keep the protein content** — Protein calculator and protein snacks content is smart. Nutrition is a massive concern for this demographic.
