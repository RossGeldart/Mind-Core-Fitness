# Customer Problems Log — Mind Core Fitness

Use this file to capture real problems your clients bring to you.
Every problem here is a potential piece of content — a post, a video, an email.

## Top Problems

### 1. "I don't have time to train"
- The #1 thing clients say when they walk in
- They're busy with work, family, life — fitness always gets pushed down the list
- The real issue isn't time, it's priority and structure

### 2. "I need someone to hold me accountable"
- They can do it when someone's watching but fall apart on their own
- They've tried solo and it doesn't stick
- They need external structure until the habit becomes internal

### 3. "I keep making excuses"
- The biggest mindset block you see
- They justify skipping sessions, eating badly, not showing up
- They know they're doing it but can't seem to stop
