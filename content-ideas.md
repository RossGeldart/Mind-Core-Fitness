## Problem: "I don't have time to train"

1. **You don't need more time. You need a non-negotiable.**
   - Format: Short video or caption
   - Hook: "Stop saying you don't have time. You have time — you just haven't made it non-negotiable."
   - Key point: Reframe time as a priority problem, not a clock problem

2. **The 30-minute rule**
   - Format: Reel / short-form video
   - Hook: "If you can't find 30 minutes for yourself, something's wrong — and it's not your schedule."
   - Key point: You don't need 90-minute gym sessions. 30 focused minutes beats nothing every time.

3. **What my busiest client does differently**
   - Format: Story post or video
   - Hook: "My busiest client runs a company, has 3 kids, and hasn't missed a session in 6 months. Here's why."
   - Key point: It's not about having time, it's about protecting it. Discipline over motivation.

## Problem: "I need someone to hold me accountable"

4. **Accountability isn't a crutch — it's a bridge**
   - Format: Caption / carousel
   - Hook: "You're not weak for needing accountability. You're smart."
   - Key point: External accountability builds the habit. The habit becomes internal over time.

5. **Why willpower alone doesn't work**
   - Format: Talking-head video
   - Hook: "Stop relying on willpower. It runs out. Here's what actually works."
   - Key point: Structure and systems beat willpower. That's what coaching gives you.

6. **The check-in that changed everything**
   - Format: Story / testimonial style
   - Hook: "One message a week. That's all it took to keep him on track."
   - Key point: Small accountability touchpoints create massive consistency.

## Problem: "I keep making excuses"

7. **Your excuses sound reasonable. That's what makes them dangerous.**
   - Format: Short video / caption
   - Hook: "The best excuses don't sound like excuses. They sound like logic."
   - Key point: "I'm too tired" and "I'll start Monday" sound reasonable. They're still excuses.

8. **The conversation you need to have with yourself**
   - Format: Talking-head video
   - Hook: "Next time you're about to skip, ask yourself one question: Am I making a decision or an excuse?"
   - Key point: Teach people to catch themselves in the moment.

9. **Discipline feels hard until it doesn't**
   - Format: Motivational caption
   - Hook: "The first 2 weeks are a fight. After that, it's just what you do."
   - Key point: The discomfort is temporary. The habit is permanent.

10. **I've heard every excuse. Here are the top 3.**
    - Format: Reel / carousel
    - Hook: "After years of coaching, I can tell you the 3 excuses I hear every single week."
    - Key point: Name the excuses so people recognise them in themselves. No shaming — just awareness.
